The **Smart Product Analyzer** accepts a product URL or a text description, automatically builds a targeted Amazon search, and scrapes the top results. It then analyzes this information, distinguishes the pros and cons, and recommends the best available product.

The **Smart Product Analyzer** is a sophisticated Spring Boot application that leverages AI to transform natural language queries into detailed e-commerce product analyses. It can analyze products directly from a URL or intelligently search for a product based on a description, scrape the results, and deliver a comprehensive summary including pros, cons, a final verdict, and a rating.

This project demonstrates a powerful integration of web scraping with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a smart, automated product intelligence tool.

## üöÄ Core Features

* **Dual-Mode Analysis**: Analyze a product either by providing a direct **URL** or a natural language **text description** (e.g., "a good mechanical keyboard under 5000").
* **AI-Powered Search**: Utilizes an AI model (via Ollama and Spring AI) to parse text descriptions into structured search criteria (keywords, brand, price range).
* **Automated Web Scraping**: Employs Selenium WebDriver to scrape Amazon product pages for names, prices, and customer reviews, with robust anti-detection configurations.
* **Intelligent Review Summarization**: Gathers product reviews and uses an AI prompt to generate a concise list of **Pros**, **Cons**, a final **Verdict**, and a calculated **Rating** out of 10.
* **RESTful API**: Provides clean, easy-to-use endpoints for initiating product analysis.
* **Resilient & Extensible**: Features custom exception handling for scraping and AI service failures, making the application robust and easy to debug.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application has two primary workflows, both accessible via the API.

#### 1. Analyze by URL

This is the direct approach. You provide an Amazon product URL, and the service scrapes and analyzes it.


```
1. POST /analyze/url with an Amazon URL.
2. `AmazonScraperService` scrapes the product's name, price, and reviews.
3. `AiService` summarizes the reviews into pros, cons, a verdict, and a rating.
4. The final `Product` object is returned as JSON.
```

#### 2. Analyze by Description (The Smart Search)

This is the advanced, AI-driven workflow. You provide a text query, and the application finds and analyzes the best matching product.


```
1. POST /analyze/description with a text query (e.g., "logitech mouse for gaming").
2. `ProductService` sends the query to `AiService`.
3. `AiService` uses the `searchQueryPrompt.txt` template to ask the LLM to extract keywords, brand, and price.
4. `ProductService` builds a precise Amazon search URL based on the AI's response.
5. `AmazonSearchPageScraper` scrapes all product links from the search results page.
6. `ProductService` iterates through the links, scrapes each one, and uses the AI-generated rating to identify the "best" product.
7. The best `Product` object is returned as JSON.
```

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21** or later.
* **Apache Maven**.
* **Git**.
* **Ollama**: The application is configured to connect to a local Ollama instance. You must have Ollama running with a model downloaded.
    * [Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
    * Pull the required model:
        ```bash
        ollama pull llama3
        ```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Saucyyy8/Smart-Product-Manager.git](https://github.com/Saucyyy8/Smart-Product-Manager.git)
cd Smart-Product-Manager
```

### 2. Configure the Application
The core configuration is in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. By default, it's set to connect to Ollama on `localhost:11434` and use the `llama3:latest` model.

```properties
# App name
spring.application.name=productAnalyzer
spring.ai.ollama.base-url=http://localhost:11434

# Specify the Ollama model to be used by the ChatClient.
spring.ai.ollama.chat.model=llama3:latest

# Optional: You can configure model-specific parameters like temperature.
spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.temperature=0.7

#Added cache

spring.cache.cache-names=Product
spring.cache.caffeine.spec=expireAfterAccess=60m

```

### 3. Run the Application
Make sure your Ollama application is running. Then, start the Spring Boot application using Maven:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## üß† AI Prompts

A key part of this project is how it instructs the AI model. The prompts are stored in the `src/main/resources/prompts/` directory.

### `searchQueryPrompt.txt`

This prompt instructs the LLM to act as a text processor and extract structured search criteria from a user's free-form text.

```
You are a text processing bot. Your task is to extract search criteria from a user's query and format it into a strict 5-line output.
...
User Query: {query}
```

### `productAnalyzer.txt`

This prompt takes a collection of scraped reviews and asks the LLM to summarize them into a structured analysis.

```
I have a product from Amazon with the following reviews:
{reviews}
Please analyze these reviews and provide the following information in this exact format:
PROS:- [list each pro...]
CONS:- [list each con...]
VERDICT:-[one-line verdict...]
RATING:-[rating out of 10...]
```
